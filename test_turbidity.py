# test_turbidity_v2.py
# A standalone script to test the turbidity sensor (DFRobot Gravity: Analog Turbidity Sensor).
# This script reads the sensor's raw ADC value, converts it to voltage, then calculates
# the final turbidity in NTU.

# This section initializes the SPI communication with the MCP3008 ADC.

# --- Calibration Values ---
# IMPORTANT: These values should be fine-tuned by testing with known liquids.
# V_REF_HIGH is the voltage in completely clear water (ideally 0 NTU).
# V_REF_LOW is the voltage in a very opaque/turbid liquid.
